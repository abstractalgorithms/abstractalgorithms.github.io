# Understanding OAuth 2.0 Grant Types: When to Use Each

OAuth 2.0 is a versatile protocol for securing access to resources in a web application. It provides different grant types, also known as flows, to cater to various use cases and security requirements. In this blog post, we'll explore these grant types, their characteristics, and when to use each of them.

## Authorization Code Grant

The Authorization Code Grant is a widely used and secure OAuth 2.0 flow. It is suitable for web applications running on a server and highly trusted clients. Here are some key scenarios for using it:

- **Web Applications**: When you have a web application that can securely store client secrets.
- **Confidential Clients**: For clients that can maintain the confidentiality of their client secrets.

## Implicit Grant

The Implicit Grant is designed for browser-based applications, such as single-page applications (SPAs), where the client code is not trusted. Consider using it in these cases:

- **JavaScript Apps**: When your application runs in a user's browser and you cannot securely store a client secret.
- **Public Clients**: For applications that cannot keep secrets confidential.

## Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant

The Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) Grant is used when no other grant type is feasible or secure. It's not recommended for most scenarios but can be considered for:

- **Legacy or Trusted Applications**: In situations where migrating to a more secure flow is not an immediate option.
- **User-Owned Devices**: When users directly input their credentials on a device (not the best practice).

## Client Credentials Grant

The Client Credentials Grant is suitable for server-to-server communication, service-to-service communication, and backend APIs where user involvement is not required. Use it when:

- **No User Involvement**: When the application interacts directly with other services and no user authentication is needed.
- **Secure Client Storage**: For clients that can securely store their credentials.

## Device Authorization Grant (Device Flow)

The Device Authorization Grant, also known as the Device Flow, is designed for devices with limited user interfaces (e.g., IoT devices) and users who cannot directly input credentials. Consider it for:

- **IoT Devices**: When IoT devices need access to resources on behalf of a user.
- **User-Friendly Authorization**: To provide user-friendly authorization on devices with constrained input capabilities.
  Certainly, let's add Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) to the list of OAuth 2.0 grant types and explain when it should be used:

## PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

PKCE (pronounced "pixy") is an extension to the Authorization Code Grant flow. It is designed to enhance the security of OAuth 2.0 by protecting against certain attacks, particularly those that target public clients, such as single-page applications (SPAs) and mobile apps. Here's when you should use PKCE:

- **Public Clients with Authorization Code Flow**: When your client application is public (cannot securely store a client secret) and you are using the Authorization Code Flow.

## Summary Comparison

Now, let's summarize these scenarios in a tabular format for easy comparison:

| Grant Type                     | When to Use It                                     | Use Case Examples                                   |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Authorization Code Grant       | - Web applications<br> - Highly trusted clients  | Secure web apps with server-side code.              |
| Implicit Grant                 | - Browser-based applications<br> - Public clients | Single-page apps in a user's browser.              |
| Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant | - Legacy apps<br> - User-owned devices    | Legacy systems or constrained device input.        |
| Client Credentials Grant       | - Server-to-server communication<br> - Backend APIs | Service-to-service communication.                   |
| Device Authorization Grant (Device Flow) | - IoT devices<br> - Limited user input | IoT devices or user-friendly device authorization. |
| PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) | - Public Clients with Authorization Code Flow | Enhancing security for public clients in Authorization Code Flow. |
