# Database Indexes: The Complete Guide

Indexes are critical for fast data retrieval in databases. This article explores what indexes are, the different types, how they work in SQL vs NoSQL systems, and what to consider for optimal performance.

## What is a Database Index?
A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional space and maintenance overhead. Think of it like an index in a book: it helps you find information quickly without scanning every page.

## Why Use Indexes?
- **Faster queries:** Indexes allow the database to locate data without scanning every row.
- **Efficient sorting and filtering:** Indexes speed up ORDER BY, WHERE, and JOIN operations.
- **Enforce uniqueness:** Unique indexes ensure no duplicate values in a column (e.g., primary keys).

## Types of Indexes
### 1. B-Tree Indexes
- Most common in relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
- Balanced tree structure for fast range and equality lookups.

### 2. Hash Indexes
- Use a hash function to map keys to locations.
- Fast for equality searches, not for range queries.
- Common in some NoSQL systems and in-memory databases.

### 3. Bitmap Indexes
- Efficient for columns with low cardinality (few unique values).
- Used in data warehousing and analytics.

### 4. Full-Text Indexes
- Specialized for searching text within large documents or columns.
- Support advanced search features (e.g., stemming, ranking).

### 5. Spatial Indexes
- Used for geospatial data (e.g., GIS, maps).
- Support queries like "find all points within a radius."

## SQL vs NoSQL Indexes
### SQL (Relational Databases)
- Indexes are typically B-Tree or variations (e.g., PostgreSQL's GiST, GIN).
- Support composite indexes (multiple columns).
- Indexes can enforce constraints (e.g., UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY).
- Schema is fixed, so indexes are defined up front.

### NoSQL (Document, Key-Value, Column, Graph)
- Indexing strategies vary widely:
  - **Document stores (MongoDB):** Support single-field, compound, text, and geospatial indexes.
  - **Key-value stores (Redis):** Often use hash or skip list structures.
  - **Column stores (Cassandra):** Use primary key and secondary indexes, but with limitations.
  - **Graph databases (Neo4j):** Index nodes and relationships for fast traversal.
- Schema is flexible; indexes can be created dynamically.
- Some NoSQL systems have limited or no support for secondary indexes.

## Things to Consider When Using Indexes
- **Write Overhead:** Every insert, update, or delete may require index maintenance, which can slow down write-heavy workloads.
- **Storage Cost:** Indexes consume disk space, especially on large tables.
- **Index Selection:** Too many indexes can hurt performance; only index columns used in queries.
- **Query Patterns:** Design indexes based on how data is accessed (e.g., filter, sort, join columns).
- **Index Fragmentation:** Over time, indexes can become fragmented and less efficient; periodic maintenance may be needed.

## What Causes Bad Query Performance?
- **Missing Indexes:** Full table scans for every query.
- **Unselective Indexes:** Indexes on columns with many repeated values (low cardinality) are less useful.
- **Too Many Indexes:** Increases write cost and can confuse the query planner.
- **Outdated Statistics:** The database optimizer relies on statistics to choose indexes; stale stats can lead to poor plans.
- **Improper Query Design:** Functions or operations on indexed columns can prevent index usage.
