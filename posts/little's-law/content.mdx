Little's Law establishes a fundamental relationship in queueing systems:

```
L = Î» Ã— W
```

- **L**: Average items in the system
- **Î»**: Arrival rate
- **W**: Average waiting time

## Why Little's Law Matters

By understanding this relationship, engineers can:

- **Predict Throughput**: Estimate system capacity under varying loads.
- **Optimize Resources**: Allocate servers or threads to meet SLAs.
- **Analyze Latency**: Correlate queue length with response times.

## Practical Example

Assume a web server receives 50 requests/second (Î») with an average response time of 0.2 seconds (W). Then:

```
L = 50 Ã— 0.2 = 10 concurrent requests
```

This simple insight guides capacity planning and performance tuning.

## Conclusion

Little's Law is a cornerstone in queueing theory, offering invaluable insights for system optimization. By mastering this principle, engineers can significantly enhance system performance and reliability.
