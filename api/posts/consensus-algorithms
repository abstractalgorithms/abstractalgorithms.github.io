Two of the most widely known algorithms are **Paxos** and **Raft**.\r\n\r\n## How They Work\r\n\r\n- **Paxos**: A family of protocols that achieves consensus through a series of proposals and acceptances. It is theoretically robust but can be complex to implement and understand.\r\n- **Raft**: Designed to be more understandable, Raft divides consensus into leader election, log replication, and safety. It is widely used in modern systems (e.g., etcd, Consul).\r\n\r\n## Fault Tolerance\r\n\r\nBoth Raft and Paxos can tolerate up to `(N-1)/2` node failures in a cluster of N nodes. This means a majority (quorum) is required for progress.\r\n\r\n## Trade-offs\r\n\r\n- **Performance**: Consensus requires coordination, which can limit throughput and increase latency.\r\n- **Availability**: If a majority of nodes are unavailable, the system cannot make progress.\r\n- **Complexity**: Paxos is harder to implement correctly; Raft is simpler but still non-trivial.\r\n\r\n## Example Use Cases\r\n\r\n- Distributed databases (e.g., CockroachDB, etcd)\r\n- Leader election in microservices\r\n\r\n## Further Reading\r\n\r\n- [The Raft Consensus Algorithm](https://raft.github.io/)\r\n- [Paxos Made Simple (Leslie Lamport)](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/paxos-simple.pdf)","tags":["distributed systems","consensus","raft","paxos","fault tolerance"],"author":"Abstract Algorithms","date":"2025-06-26","series":null,"coverImage":null,"isDraft":false}
