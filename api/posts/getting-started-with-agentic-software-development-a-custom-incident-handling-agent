This post introduces the principles of agentic software development and walks through a real-world use case of automating incident response with memory, log search, ticketing, and remediation.","content":"Agentic software development is redefining how we build applications by leveraging **autonomous agents**‚Äîself-directed programs powered by large language models (LLMs) that can reason, plan, and act based on context.\r\n\r\nIn this blog, we'll walk through building a **custom incident handling agent**, a real-world example that showcases the power of agentic systems to monitor, diagnose, and react to incidents in production environments.\r\n\r\n## üß† Use Case: Custom Incident Handling Agent\r\n\r\n### üéØ Problem\r\nDevOps teams often face alert fatigue. A typical on-call engineer receives hundreds of alerts, most of which are false positives, duplicates, or non-actionable.\r\n\r\n### üí° Solution\r\nBuild an LLM-powered agent that:\r\n1. Monitors alert sources (e.g., Prometheus, Datadog)\r\n2. Classifies and summarizes incidents\r\n3. Diagnoses the root cause using logs or metrics\r\n4. Notifies the correct team with actionable insights\r\n5. (Optional) Auto-remediates common issues\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview\r\n\r\n```plaintext\r\n[ Alert Source ] ---> [ Incident Agent ] ---> [ Notification / Ticket / Remediation ]\r\n                          |\r\n                 +--------+---------+\r\n                 | Memory + Logs    |\r\n                 | External Tools   |\r\n                 +------------------+\r\nAgent Runtime: LangChain, OpenAI Function calling\r\n\r\nTools: API access to logs (e.g., ELK), metrics, ticketing (e.g., Jira)\r\n\r\nMemory: Conversation history + prior resolutions (e.g., Redis or vector DB)\r\n```\r\n\r\nüõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step: Building the Agent\r\n\r\n1. Setup LangChain Agent\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.agents import initialize_agent\r\nfrom langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\r\n\r\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\")\r\nagent = initialize_agent(llm=llm, tools=[your_tool_list], agent_type=\"openai-functions\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Define Tools for the Agent\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.tools import Tool\r\n\r\ndef search_logs(query):\r\n    # Connect to logging platform (e.g., ELK or Datadog)\r\n    return perform_log_search(query)\r\n\r\ntools = [\r\n    Tool(name=\"LogSearch\", func=search_logs, description=\"Search logs for given query\"),\r\n    Tool(name=\"CreateTicket\", func=create_jira_ticket, description=\"Create a ticket in Jira\")\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add Memory for Incident Context\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory\r\nmemory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Prompt Engineering\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprompt = \"\"\"\r\nYou are an incident handling agent.\r\n1. Summarize alerts.\r\n2. Search logs for root cause.\r\n3. Create a detailed summary.\r\n4. Notify or trigger remediation.\r\n\"\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Run the Agent Loop\r\n\r\n```python\r\nresponse = agent.run(\"There are multiple CPU spike alerts in region-us-east\")\r\nprint(response)\r\n```\r\n\r\n‚úÖ Example Output\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nIncident Summary:\r\n- Multiple CPU spikes detected across 3 hosts.\r\n- Logs indicate a deployment at 12:05 UTC may have caused the surge.\r\n- Recommend scaling down service B temporarily.\r\n- Jira ticket #INC-456 created for SRE team.\r\n```\r\n\r\nüîê Security and Safety\r\n\r\n- Validate actions: Only allow certain APIs to be called autonomously\r\n- Use human-in-the-loop for sensitive remediations\r\n- Log all decisions taken by the agent for auditability\r\n\r\nüöÄ Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nAgentic software enables a leap in automation by introducing reasoning and contextual intelligence to our systems. This custom incident handling agent is just the beginning. You can extend it with:\r\n\r\n- Feedback loops for learning from past incidents\r\n- Real-time dashboards\r\n- ChatOps integration (e.g., Slack)\r\n\r\nStay tuned for a follow-up post where we build a fully autonomous agent with recovery scripts and risk scoring.","tags":["Agentic Software","LLM Agents","Incident Management","LangChain","OpenAI","Autonomous Agents"],"author":"Abstract Algorithms","date":"2025-06-24","series":null,"coverImage":null,"isDraft":false}
