- 🔍 **SEO Optimized**: Built-in meta tags, Open Graph, and structured data
- 📊 **Reading Time**: Automatic reading time estimation for posts
- 🎯 **GitHub Pages**: Easy deployment with GitHub Actions
- 🔄 **Automated Releases**: Automatic GitHub releases for every deployment
- 📱 **Android App**: Native Android WebView app with automated APK builds
- 🔙 **Rollback Support**: One-click rollback to previous deployments

## 🚀 Deployment & Releases

This project features a fully automated CI/CD pipeline:

### Automatic Website Deployment
- **Trigger**: Every push to `main` branch (excluding Android-only changes)
- **Process**: Build → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Create Release
- **URL**: [https://abstractalgorithms.github.io](https://abstractalgorithms.github.io)

### Automatic GitHub Releases
- **Created**: After every successful deployment
- **Format**: `v{YYYY.MM.DD}-{run_number}` (e.g., `v2024.12.19-42`)
- **Content**: Changelog, deployment details, contributor list, and quick links
- **Cleanup**: Automatically removes releases older than the latest 10

### Android APK Builds
- **Trigger**: Changes to `android/` directory or manual dispatch
- **Output**: Debug and release APKs available as artifacts
- **Independent**: Android build failures don't affect web deployment

### Rollback Capability
- **Manual Trigger**: Via GitHub Actions workflow
- **Target**: Last successful deployment or specific commit
- **Safe**: Preserves deployment history and creates rollback releases

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/abstractalgorithms.github.io.git
cd abstractalgorithms.github.io
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Writing Posts

Posts are written in MDX format and stored in the `public/posts/` directory. Each post should be in its own folder with an `index.mdx` file.

### Post Structure

```
public/posts/
├── my-post-slug/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   └── assets/
│       └── image.png
```

### Post Frontmatter

Each post must include frontmatter with the following fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2024-01-15"
excerpt: "A brief description of your post"
author: "Your Name"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
coverImage: "/posts/my-post-slug/assets/cover.jpg" # optional
---
```

### Example Post

```mdx
---
title: "Understanding Binary Search Trees"
date: "2024-01-15"
excerpt: "A comprehensive guide to Binary Search Trees and their applications"
author: "Alex Thompson"
tags: ["data-structures", "algorithms", "trees"]
coverImage: "/posts/bst-guide/assets/cover.png"
---

# Understanding Binary Search Trees

Binary Search Trees are fundamental data structures...

## Key Properties

1. Left subtree values are less than the root
2. Right subtree values are greater than the root
3. Both subtrees are also BSTs

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = null;
    this.right = null;
  }
}
```
```

## Deployment

The site is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

### Automatic GitHub Pages Setup

1. **Repository Settings**:
   - Go to your repository Settings → Pages
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"**
   - The workflow will automatically deploy when you push to the main branch

2. **First Deployment**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial blog setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **The GitHub Action will**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Build the Next.js project with static export
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`

### Manual Deployment

If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
npm run build
# The 'out' directory contains the static files ready for deployment
```

### Environment Variables

If you need environment variables for production:

1. Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add any required environment variables
3. Reference them in the GitHub Actions workflow if needed
