## What is CIDR

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a method for assigning unique addresses to devices on a computer network. CIDR employs a prefix notation to represent IP addresses as well as their associated subnet masks. The prefix indicates the number of bits used in the subnet mask to identify the network portion of the address. For instance, a prefix of /24 indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address identify the network and the remaining 8 bits identify individual devices on the network.

CIDR enables network administrators to use IP addresses more efficiently and design networks more flexibly. For instance, they can divide a large network into smaller subnets and assign unique IP addresses to each device on those subnets.

### Example

10.0.0.0/**24**

**24**-bits are used to identify the network and the remaining 8-bits are used to identify the host.

#### Available IPs

The formula to calculate the number of assignable IP addresses to CIDR networks is "**Subtract the number of network bits from 32. Raise 2 to that power and subtract 2 for the network and broadcast addresses**". For example, a /24 network has 2^(32 - 24)Â - 2 addresses available for host assignment.

Some example ranges as per the above formula:

| CIDR Notation | Available Bits | Host Formula | Available Hosts |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| /8            | 32 - 8 = 24    | 2^24 - 2     | 16,777,214      |
| /16           | 32 - 16 = 16   | 2^16 - 2     | 65,534          |
| /24           | 32 - 24 = 8    | 2^8 - 2      | 254             |
| /26           | 32 - 26 = 6    | 2^6 - 2      | 62              |
| /28           | 32 - 28 = 4    | 2^4 - 2      | 14              |
| /30           | 32 - 30 = 2    | 2^2 - 2      | 2               |

## Conclusion

In conclusion, CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a powerful method in computer networking for efficiently assigning unique addresses to devices. By utilizing a prefix notation that signifies the number of bits used in the subnet mask, CIDR allows for precise identification of network portions in IP addresses. This flexibility empowers network administrators to design and manage networks more efficiently, breaking down large networks into smaller, manageable subnets with unique IP assignments.
