Latency impacts everything from user experience to system throughput. Below is a curated table of typical latencies to use as a quick reference when designing and optimizing systems.

| **Operation**                   | **Latency (Approx.)** | **Context**                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| L1 Cache Access                 | 1 ns                  | On-die CPU cache, fastest memory access     |
| L2 Cache Access                 | 3 ns                  | Secondary cache, slightly slower            |
| Main Memory (RAM)               | 100 ns                | DRAM access                                 |
| SSD Read                        | 100 Î¼s                | Modern NVMe SSDs                            |
| HDD Seek                        | 10 ms                 | Mechanical disk seek                        |
| Network Round Trip (Local LAN)  | 0.5 ms                | Within data center                          |
| Network Round Trip (Internet)   | 20â€“200 ms             | Global internet latency                     |

## Applying Latency Knowledge

1. **Cache Optimization**: Align data structures to minimize cache misses.
2. **I/O Batching**: Reduce SSD and network calls by batching operations.
3. **Asynchronous Patterns**: Use non-blocking I/O to hide latency.
