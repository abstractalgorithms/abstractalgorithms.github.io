## Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1: E-commerce Platform Optimization

#### The Challenge
An e-commerce platform with 10 million products and 1 million daily active users was experiencing:
- Product search queries taking 3-5 seconds
- Checkout process timeouts during peak hours
- Admin dashboard reports timing out
- Database CPU at 90% during traffic spikes

#### The Solution

**Phase 1: Critical Query Optimization**
```sql
-- Original slow product search query
SELECT p.*, c.name as category_name, AVG(r.rating) as avg_rating
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id
WHERE p.name ILIKE '%wireless%'
   OR p.description ILIKE '%wireless%'
GROUP BY p.id, c.name
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Problem: Full table scans, expensive ILIKE operations, complex aggregations
-- Execution time: 4.2 seconds
```

**Optimized Approach:**
```sql
-- Step 1: Create full-text search index
CREATE INDEX idx_products_search 
ON products 
USING gin(to_tsvector('english', name || ' ' || description));

-- Step 2: Denormalize ratings for faster access
CREATE TABLE product_ratings_cache (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    avg_rating DECIMAL(3,2),
    review_count INT,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Trigger to maintain ratings cache
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_product_rating_cache()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO product_ratings_cache (product_id, avg_rating, review_count)
    SELECT 
        NEW.product_id,
        AVG(rating),
        COUNT(*)
    FROM reviews 
    WHERE product_id = NEW.product_id
    GROUP BY product_id
    ON CONFLICT (product_id) 
    DO UPDATE SET 
        avg_rating = EXCLUDED.avg_rating,
        review_count = EXCLUDED.review_count,
        last_updated = NOW();
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Step 3: Optimized search query
SELECT 
    p.id,
    p.name,
    p.price,
    p.image_url,
    c.name as category_name,
    prc.avg_rating,
    prc.review_count
FROM products p
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN product_ratings_cache prc ON p.id = prc.product_id
WHERE to_tsvector('english', p.name || ' ' || p.description) @@ to_tsquery('english', 'wireless')
ORDER BY 
    CASE WHEN prc.avg_rating IS NOT NULL THEN prc.avg_rating ELSE 0 END DESC,
    p.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Result: Query time reduced from 4.2s to 0.08s (98% improvement)
```

**Phase 2: Checkout Optimization**
```sql
-- Original checkout process issues:
-- 1. Inventory checks were slow
-- 2. Multiple round trips to database
-- 3. Lock contention during updates

-- Solution: Batch operations with proper indexing
CREATE INDEX idx_inventory_product_location ON inventory(product_id, warehouse_location);
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_processing ON orders(status, created_at) WHERE status = 'processing';

-- Optimized checkout procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_checkout(
    p_customer_id INT,
    p_items JSONB,
    p_shipping_address JSONB
) RETURNS JSON AS $$
DECLARE
    v_order_id INT;
    v_item JSONB;
    v_total DECIMAL(10,2) := 0;
    v_insufficient_stock TEXT[];
BEGIN
    -- Step 1: Validate inventory in batch
    SELECT array_agg(
        CASE 
            WHEN i.available_quantity < (item->>'quantity')::INT 
            THEN item->>'product_id'
        END
    ) INTO v_insufficient_stock
    FROM jsonb_array_elements(p_items) AS item
    JOIN inventory i ON i.product_id = (item->>'product_id')::INT
    WHERE i.available_quantity < (item->>'quantity')::INT;
    
    IF array_length(v_insufficient_stock, 1) > 0 THEN
        RETURN json_build_object(
            'success', false,
            'error', 'insufficient_stock',
            'products', v_insufficient_stock
        );
    END IF;
    
    -- Step 2: Create order and reserve inventory atomically
    INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, status, shipping_address, created_at)
    VALUES (p_customer_id, 'confirmed', p_shipping_address, NOW())
    RETURNING id INTO v_order_id;
    
    -- Step 3: Batch insert order items and update inventory
    INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price)
    SELECT 
        v_order_id,
        (item->>'product_id')::INT,
        (item->>'quantity')::INT,
        p.price
    FROM jsonb_array_elements(p_items) AS item
    JOIN products p ON p.id = (item->>'product_id')::INT;
    
    -- Step 4: Update inventory in batch
    UPDATE inventory 
    SET available_quantity = available_quantity - subquery.quantity
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            (item->>'product_id')::INT as product_id,
            (item->>'quantity')::INT as quantity
        FROM jsonb_array_elements(p_items) AS item
    ) AS subquery
    WHERE inventory.product_id = subquery.product_id;
    
    -- Step 5: Calculate total
    SELECT SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) INTO v_total
    FROM order_items oi
    WHERE oi.order_id = v_order_id;
    
    UPDATE orders SET total_amount = v_total WHERE id = v_order_id;
    
    RETURN json_build_object(
        'success', true,
        'order_id', v_order_id,
        'total', v_total
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Result: Checkout time reduced from 2.3s to 0.3s (87% improvement)
```

**Results:**
- Search performance: 98% improvement (4.2s → 0.08s)
- Checkout performance: 87% improvement (2.3s → 0.3s)
- Database CPU utilization: 90% → 45%
- Peak hour success rate: 85% → 99.5%

### Case Study 2: Social Media Analytics Platform

#### The Challenge
A social media analytics platform processing 100M events/day faced:
- Real-time dashboard queries taking 15+ seconds
- ETL processes blocking user queries
- Reporting queries causing memory issues
- Unable to scale beyond current load

#### The Solution

**Phase 1: Time-Series Data Optimization**
```sql
-- Original events table (100M+ rows)
CREATE TABLE events (
    id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    platform VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Problem: Single massive table, no partitioning, slow aggregations

-- Solution: Partitioned time-series design
CREATE TABLE events_partitioned (
    id BIGINT,
    user_id BIGINT,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    platform VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    metadata JSONB,
    processed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
) PARTITION BY RANGE (timestamp);

-- Create monthly partitions
CREATE TABLE events_2024_01 PARTITION OF events_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');
CREATE TABLE events_2024_02 PARTITION OF events_partitioned
    FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');
-- ... continue for each month

-- Indexes per partition
CREATE INDEX idx_events_2024_01_user_type ON events_2024_01(user_id, event_type, timestamp);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_2024_01_platform_time ON events_2024_01(platform, timestamp);

-- Automated partition management
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partition(target_date DATE)
RETURNS VOID AS $$
DECLARE
    partition_name TEXT;
    start_date DATE;
    end_date DATE;
BEGIN
    start_date := date_trunc('month', target_date);
    end_date := start_date + INTERVAL '1 month';
    partition_name := 'events_' || to_char(start_date, 'YYYY_MM');
    
    EXECUTE format('
        CREATE TABLE %I PARTITION OF events_partitioned
        FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
        partition_name, start_date, end_date
    );
    
    -- Create indexes
    EXECUTE format('
        CREATE INDEX %I ON %I(user_id, event_type, timestamp)',
        'idx_' || partition_name || '_user_type', partition_name
    );
    
    EXECUTE format('
        CREATE INDEX %I ON %I(platform, timestamp)',
        'idx_' || partition_name || '_platform_time', partition_name
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Phase 2: Materialized Views for Analytics**
```sql
-- Create materialized views for common aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_event_stats AS
SELECT 
    date_trunc('hour', timestamp) as hour,
    platform,
    event_type,
    COUNT(*) as event_count,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM events_partitioned
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY date_trunc('hour', timestamp), platform, event_type;

CREATE INDEX idx_hourly_stats_time_platform ON hourly_event_stats(hour, platform);

-- Automated refresh
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_hourly_stats()
RETURNS VOID AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY hourly_event_stats;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule refresh every hour
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-hourly-stats', '0 * * * *', 'SELECT refresh_hourly_stats();');

-- Daily aggregations
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_platform_stats AS
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', timestamp) as day,
    platform,
    COUNT(*) as total_events,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as daily_active_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FILTER (WHERE event_type = 'login') as login_users
FROM events_partitioned
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '365 days'
GROUP BY date_trunc('day', timestamp), platform;

-- Fast dashboard queries
SELECT 
    platform,
    SUM(total_events) as events_last_7_days,
    AVG(daily_active_users) as avg_daily_users
FROM daily_platform_stats
WHERE day >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY platform;

-- Result: Dashboard query time 15s → 0.2s (99% improvement)
```

**Phase 3: Columnar Storage for Analytics**
```sql
-- Create columnar table for heavy analytics
-- (Using Citus columnar extension)
CREATE TABLE events_analytics (
    user_id BIGINT,
    event_type VARCHAR(50),
    platform VARCHAR(20),
    event_date DATE,
    event_hour INT,
    metadata_category VARCHAR(100),
    session_duration INT
) USING columnar;

-- ETL process to populate columnar table
INSERT INTO events_analytics
SELECT 
    user_id,
    event_type,
    platform,
    DATE(timestamp) as event_date,
    EXTRACT(HOUR FROM timestamp) as event_hour,
    metadata->>'category' as metadata_category,
    CASE 
        WHEN event_type = 'session_end' 
        THEN (metadata->>'duration')::INT 
        ELSE NULL 
    END as session_duration
FROM events_partitioned
WHERE DATE(timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day';

-- Complex analytics queries now run much faster
SELECT 
    platform,
    event_date,
    COUNT(*) as events,
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users,
    AVG(session_duration) FILTER (WHERE session_duration IS NOT NULL) as avg_session
FROM events_analytics
WHERE event_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY platform, event_date
ORDER BY platform, event_date;

-- Result: Complex analytics queries 45s → 3s (93% improvement)
```

**Results:**
- Dashboard performance: 99% improvement (15s → 0.2s)
- Complex analytics: 93% improvement (45s → 3s)
- ETL impact on user queries: Eliminated
- System scalability: 3x increase in throughput

### Case Study 3: Financial Services Transaction Processing

#### The Challenge
A fintech company processing 50M transactions/day experienced:
- Fraud detection queries timing out
- Account balance calculations taking minutes
- Compliance reports causing system outages
- Unable to provide real-time balance updates

#### The Solution

**Phase 1: Transaction Processing Optimization**
```sql
-- Original design issues:
-- 1. All transactions in single table

## Migration Strategies

### Zero-Downtime Index Creation

```sql
-- PostgreSQL: Concurrent index creation
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email_new ON users(email);

-- Rename old index and activate new one
BEGIN;
ALTER INDEX idx_users_email RENAME TO idx_users_email_old;
ALTER INDEX idx_users_email_new RENAME TO idx_users_email;
COMMIT;

-- Drop old index
DROP INDEX idx_users_email_old;
```

```sql
-- SQL Server: Online index operations
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email_new ON users(email)
WITH (ONLINE = ON, SORT_IN_TEMPDB = ON);

-- Switch indexes atomically
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
EXEC sp_rename 'users.idx_users_email', 'idx_users_email_old', 'INDEX';
EXEC sp_rename 'users.idx_users_email_new', 'idx_users_email', 'INDEX';
COMMIT;

DROP INDEX idx_users_email_old ON users;
```

### Schema Migration Best Practices

```python

            execution_time = time.time() - start_time
            
            if execution_time > max_time:
                print(f"Query too slow: {execution_time}s > {max_time}s")
                return False
        
        return True
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Performance Issues

#### Issue 1: Query Suddenly Became Slow
```sql
-- Diagnostic steps:

-- 1. Check for missing statistics
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    last_analyze,
    n_tup_ins + n_tup_upd + n_tup_del as total_changes
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE last_analyze < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 week'
ORDER BY total_changes DESC;

-- 2. Check for index bloat
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as size,
    idx_scan,
    idx_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0 
  AND pg_relation_size(indexrelid) > 1000000  -- 1MB+
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;

-- 3. Check for lock contention
SELECT 
    mode,
    locktype,
    database,
    relation,
    page,
    tuple,
    classid,
    granted,
    pid
FROM pg_locks
WHERE NOT granted;

-- Solutions:
-- 1. Update statistics: ANALYZE table_name;
-- 2. Rebuild bloated indexes: REINDEX INDEX index_name;
-- 3. Identify blocking queries and optimize them
```

#### Issue 2: High CPU Usage
```sql
-- Find expensive queries
SELECT 
    query,
    calls,
    total_time / calls as avg_time,
    rows / calls as avg_rows,
    100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements 
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Check for sequential scans on large tables
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    seq_tup_read,
    seq_tup_read / GREATEST(seq_scan, 1) as avg_seq_read,
    n_tup_ins + n_tup_upd + n_tup_del as total_writes
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE seq_scan > 100
  AND seq_tup_read / GREATEST(seq_scan, 1) > 10000
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC;
```

### Index Optimization Checklist

#### Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Analyze current query patterns using query logs
- [ ] Identify slow queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
- [ ] Check existing index usage statistics
- [ ] Estimate index size and maintenance overhead
- [ ] Plan for index creation during low-traffic periods
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures

#### Post-Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Monitor query performance improvements
- [ ] Check index usage statistics
- [ ] Verify no regression in write performance
- [ ] Monitor disk space usage
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Schedule regular index maintenance

### Production Deployment Guidelines

#### Deployment Strategy
1. **Test Environment**: Replicate production data volume and query patterns
2. **Staging Deployment**: Deploy to staging with production-like traffic
3. **Canary Deployment**: Deploy to subset of production servers
4. **Full Deployment**: Roll out to all production servers
5. **Monitor and Optimize**: Continuous monitoring and adjustment

#### Monitoring Checklist
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Production index monitoring script

DB_NAME="production_db"
ALERT_EMAIL="ops-team@company.com"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/db-index-monitor.log"

# Check for slow queries
SLOW_QUERIES=$(psql -d $DB_NAME -t -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM pg_stat_statements 
WHERE mean_time > 1000  -- Queries taking more than 1 second
")

if [ "$SLOW_QUERIES" -gt 5 ]; then
    echo "$(date): WARNING: $SLOW_QUERIES slow queries detected" >> $LOG_FILE
    # Send alert email
fi

# Check for unused indexes
UNUSED_INDEXES=$(psql -d $DB_NAME -t -c "
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes 
WHERE idx_scan = 0 
  AND pg_relation_size(indexrelid) > 100000000  -- 100MB+
")

if [ "$UNUSED_INDEXES" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "$(date): INFO: $UNUSED_INDEXES large unused indexes found" >> $LOG_FILE
fi

# Check index fragmentation (example for SQL Server)
# Adapt for your database system

echo "$(date): Index monitoring completed" >> $LOG_FILE
```

## Best Practices Summary

### Design Principles
1. **Understand Your Workload**: OLTP vs OLAP vs Mixed workloads require different strategies
2. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic indexes, optimize based on actual usage patterns
3. **Measure Everything**: Use query analysis tools and performance monitoring
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Always test index changes in production-like environments

### Implementation Guidelines
1. **Index Selectivity**: Create indexes on high-selectivity columns first
2. **Composite Index Order**: Follow the ESR rule (Equality, Sort, Range)
3. **Covering Indexes**: Include frequently accessed columns to avoid table lookups
4. **Maintenance Windows**: Plan index operations during low-traffic periods

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Regular Health Checks**: Monitor index usage, fragmentation, and performance
2. **Automated Maintenance**: Set up automated statistics updates and index rebuilding
3. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor index growth and plan for storage requirements
4. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of index changes and their impact

### Performance Optimization
1. **Query Optimization**: Optimize queries to make effective use of indexes
2. **Connection Management**: Use connection pooling and proper timeout settings
3. **Caching Strategies**: Implement appropriate caching at multiple levels
4. **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas to distribute read workload
