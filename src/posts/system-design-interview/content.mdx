## The System Design Interview Process

Understanding the interview format is crucial for success. Most system design interviews follow a predictable structure that allows candidates to demonstrate their architectural thinking and problem-solving skills.

### Key Interview Phases

1. **Requirements Clarification (5-10 minutes)**
   - Define functional requirements
   - Identify non-functional requirements
   - Establish scale and constraints

2. **High-Level Design (15-20 minutes)**
   - Sketch the overall architecture
   - Identify major components
   - Define data flow

3. **Detailed Design (15-20 minutes)**
   - Deep dive into critical components
   - Database schema design
   - API design

4. **Scale and Optimize (10-15 minutes)**
   - Address bottlenecks
   - Discuss caching strategies
   - Handle edge cases

## The Universal Template

Every system design problem can be approached using this template:

### 1. Functional Requirements

**Actors**: Define who will use the system
- Reader
- Writer
- Admin

**Use Cases**: Define how actors interact with the system
- How the Reader will use the system
- How the Writer will use the system
- Administrative functions

**Features**: List specific functionality
- What features are needed by each actor
- What is explicitly out of scope

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements

Define NFR expectations for all actors:
- **Scalability**: How many users? Growth expectations?
- **Availability**: Uptime requirements (99.9%, 99.99%?)
- **Performance**: Latency expectations for reads/writes
- **Data Consistency**: Strong vs eventual consistency needs

### 3. Estimations

**User Metrics**:
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)

**Throughput**:
- Queries Per Second (QPS) for reads
- Queries Per Second (QPS) for writes
- Read/Write ratio

**Storage Estimations**:
- Data per user/action
- Daily storage needs
- Annual storage needs
- 5-10 year projections

**Memory Estimations**:
- Cache requirements
- RAM needs per server
- Disk storage requirements

**Scale Reference**:
| Unit | Decimal | Storage |
|------|---------|---------|
| Million | 10^6 | Megabytes |
| Billion | 10^9 | Gigabytes |
| Trillion | 10^12 | Terabytes |
| Quadrillion | 10^15 | Petabytes |

### 4. Design Goals

**Performance Requirements**:
- Latency targets
- Throughput requirements
- Consistency vs Availability trade-offs

**Architecture Patterns**:
- Pipe and Filter Pattern
- Event Driven Architecture
- Pub/Sub Messaging
- Streaming Processing

**Usage Patterns**:
| Workload Type | Example | Explanation |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Read Heavy | Social Media | High read traffic from users browsing content |
| Write Heavy | Logging, Transactions | Frequent write operations for data capture |
| Balanced | E-Commerce | Mix of reads (browsing) and writes (orders) |
| Batch Processing | Analytics | Large data volumes processed in scheduled batches |
| Real-time | Trading, Monitoring | Immediate response to events required |

**Data Access Patterns**:
| Access Type | Use Case | Additional Information |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Sequential Access | File Processing | Read/write data in order |
| Random Access | Database Lookup | Access specific data by key/index |
| Write Once, Read Many | Archival, Config | Data written once, read frequently |
| Pattern Matching | Log Analysis | Extract patterns using regex or similar |
| Range Queries | Time-series Data | Query data within specific ranges |

## Core Concepts to Master

### Scalability Fundamentals

**Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**:
- Add more servers to handle increased load
- Better fault tolerance and cost-effectiveness
- Examples: Web servers, microservices

**Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**:
- Increase power of existing machines
- Simpler to implement but has physical limits
- Examples: Database upgrades, CPU/RAM increases

### Database Strategies

**SQL vs NoSQL**:
- **SQL**: ACID properties, complex queries, structured data
- **NoSQL**: Horizontal scaling, flexible schema, specific use cases

**Database Patterns**:
- **Master-Slave Replication**: Read scaling
- **Master-Master Replication**: Write scaling with conflicts
- **Database Sharding**: Horizontal partitioning
- **Federation**: Split databases by function

### Caching Strategies

**Cache Patterns**:
- **Cache-Aside**: Application manages cache
- **Write-Through**: Write to cache and database simultaneously
- **Write-Behind**: Write to cache first, database later
- **Refresh-Ahead**: Proactively refresh cache before expiration

**Cache Levels**:
- Browser cache
- CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- Load balancer cache
- Application cache
- Database cache

### Communication Patterns

**Synchronous Communication**:
- HTTP/HTTPS requests
- RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)
- GraphQL

**Asynchronous Communication**:
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)
- Pub/Sub systems
- Event streaming

## Common Design Patterns

### Microservices Architecture
- Service decomposition
- API Gateway pattern
- Service discovery
- Circuit breaker pattern

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Event sourcing
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions

### Data Management Patterns
- Database per service
- Shared database anti-pattern
- Event-driven data synchronization

## Preparation Tips

### Study Strategy
1. **Understand fundamentals**: Master basic concepts before diving into complex problems
2. **Practice systematically**: Use the template for every problem
3. **Learn from real systems**: Study how actual systems like Google, Facebook, and Amazon work
4. **Think about trade-offs**: Every design decision has pros and cons
5. **Practice communication**: Explain your thinking process clearly

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Jumping to solution without understanding requirements
- Over-engineering the initial design
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Not considering scalability from the start
- Poor time management during the interview
