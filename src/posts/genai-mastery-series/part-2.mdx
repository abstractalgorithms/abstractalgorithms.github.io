## üß† Neural Networks Basics

Neural networks are inspired by biological neural networks and are the building blocks of deep learning.

![Neural Network Architecture](../assets/neural-network.png)
*Basic neural network structure*

### The Neuron (Perceptron)

A single neuron performs:
1. **Weighted Sum**: Combines inputs with learned weights
2. **Bias Addition**: Adds a learnable bias term
3. **Activation Function**: Applies non-linearity

```python
# Mathematical representation
output = activation_function(Œ£(wi √ó xi) + bias)
```

### Common Activation Functions

![Activation Functions](../assets/activation-functions.png)
*Popular activation functions and their properties*

- **ReLU**: Simple, effective, prevents vanishing gradients
- **Sigmoid**: Smooth, outputs between 0 and 1
- **Tanh**: Symmetric around zero, outputs between -1 and 1
- **Softmax**: Used for multi-class classification

### Multi-Layer Networks

**Input Layer**: Receives the data
**Hidden Layers**: Process and transform the data
**Output Layer**: Produces the final prediction

```python
# Simple neural network example
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.hidden = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.output = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.hidden(x))
        x = self.output(x)
        return x
```

## üèãÔ∏è Training Process

Training a neural network involves iteratively adjusting weights to minimize prediction errors.

![Training Process](../assets/training-process.png)
*The training loop: forward pass, loss calculation, backpropagation*

### Key Components

**1. Loss Function**: Measures how wrong the predictions are
- **Classification**: Cross-entropy loss
- **Regression**: Mean squared error
- **Custom**: Task-specific losses

**2. Optimizer**: Updates model weights
- **SGD**: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rates
- **AdamW**: Adam with weight decay

**3. Backpropagation**: Computes gradients efficiently
- Chain rule of calculus
- Automatic differentiation
- Gradient flow through layers

### Training Steps

```python
# Training loop pseudocode
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # Forward pass
        predictions = model(batch.inputs)
        loss = loss_function(predictions, batch.targets)
        
        # Backward pass
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Challenges and Solutions

**Overfitting**: Model memorizes training data
- **Solutions**: Regularization, dropout, early stopping

**Underfitting**: Model is too simple
- **Solutions**: More complexity, better features

**Vanishing Gradients**: Gradients become too small
- **Solutions**: Better activation functions, residual connections

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

Proper evaluation is crucial for understanding model performance.

![Evaluation Metrics](../assets/evaluation-metrics.png)
*Different metrics for different tasks*

### Classification Metrics

**Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
```python
accuracy = correct_predictions / total_predictions
```

**Precision**: Of predicted positives, how many are actually positive?
```python
precision = true_positives / (true_positives + false_positives)
```

**Recall**: Of actual positives, how many did we predict correctly?
```python
recall = true_positives / (true_positives + false_negatives)
```

**F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
```python
f1 = 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall)
```

### Regression Metrics

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared differences
**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute differences
**R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained

### Cross-Validation

![Cross-Validation](../assets/cross-validation.png)
*K-fold cross-validation for robust evaluation*

Splits data into k folds, trains on k-1, validates on 1, repeats k times.
