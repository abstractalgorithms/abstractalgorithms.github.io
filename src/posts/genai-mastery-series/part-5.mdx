## üìù Fundamentals of Prompting

Effective prompting is about clear communication, structured thinking, and understanding how language models process information.

![Prompt Anatomy](../assets/prompt-anatomy.png)
*Breaking down the components of an effective prompt*

### Core Principles

**üéØ Clarity**: Be specific and unambiguous
**üìã Structure**: Organize information logically
**üîÑ Context**: Provide relevant background
**‚úÖ Examples**: Show desired output format
**üéöÔ∏è Control**: Guide model behavior explicitly

### Basic Prompt Structure

```python
def create_basic_prompt(task, context=None, examples=None, instructions=None):
    """
    Create a well-structured prompt following best practices
    """
    prompt_parts = []
    
    # 1. Role/Context Setting
    if context:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Context: {context}")
    
    # 2. Task Description
    prompt_parts.append(f"Task: {task}")
    
    # 3. Examples (if provided)
    if examples:
        prompt_parts.append("Examples:")
        for i, example in enumerate(examples, 1):
            prompt_parts.append(f"Example {i}:")
            prompt_parts.append(f"Input: {example['input']}")
            prompt_parts.append(f"Output: {example['output']}")
    
    # 4. Specific Instructions
    if instructions:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Instructions: {instructions}")
    
    # 5. Input Placeholder
    prompt_parts.append("Now, please process the following:")
    
    return "\n\n".join(prompt_parts)

# Example usage
task = "Classify the sentiment of the given text"
context = "You are a sentiment analysis expert"
examples = [
    {"input": "I love this product!", "output": "Positive"},
    {"input": "This is terrible.", "output": "Negative"}
]
instructions = "Respond with only: Positive, Negative, or Neutral"

prompt_template = create_basic_prompt(task, context, examples, instructions)
print(prompt_template)
```

### Prompt Components Deep Dive

**1. Role Assignment**
```python
# Effective role assignment
def create_role_prompt(role, expertise, task):
    return f"""You are a {role} with expertise in {expertise}.
    
Your task is to {task}.

Please approach this with your professional knowledge and experience."""

# Examples
data_scientist_prompt = create_role_prompt(
    "senior data scientist",
    "machine learning and statistical analysis", 
    "analyze the given dataset and provide insights"
)

creative_writer_prompt = create_role_prompt(
    "award-winning creative writer",
    "storytelling and character development",
    "write an engaging short story based on the prompt"
)
```

**2. Context Setting**
```python
def add_context(base_prompt, context_type, details):
    """
    Add specific context to improve prompt effectiveness
    """
    context_templates = {
        "audience": f"Your audience consists of {details}.",
        "constraints": f"Important constraints: {details}",
        "background": f"Background information: {details}",
        "goals": f"The primary goals are: {details}",
        "format": f"Please format your response as: {details}"
    }
    
    context_text = context_templates.get(context_type, f"{context_type}: {details}")
    return f"{base_prompt}\n\n{context_text}"

# Example
base = "Explain quantum computing"
with_audience = add_context(base, "audience", "high school students with basic physics knowledge")
with_format = add_context(with_audience, "format", "a structured explanation with analogies and examples")
```

---

## üéØ Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot Learning

Different prompting approaches based on the number of examples provided to guide the model's behavior.

![Shot Learning Spectrum](../assets/shot-learning.png)
*From zero examples to many: the spectrum of in-context learning*

### Zero-Shot Learning

No examples provided - rely on the model's pre-training knowledge.

```python
def zero_shot_prompt(task, input_text):
    """
    Create a zero-shot prompt with clear instructions
    """
    return f"""Task: {task}

Input: {input_text}

Output:"""

# Examples
sentiment_prompt = zero_shot_prompt(
    "Determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral",
    "The weather today is absolutely perfect for a picnic!"
)

translation_prompt = zero_shot_prompt(
    "Translate the following English text to French",
    "Hello, how are you today?"
)

summarization_prompt = zero_shot_prompt(
    "Summarize the following text in one sentence",
    "Long article text here..."
)
```

### One-Shot Learning

Provide a single example to demonstrate the desired format and approach.

```python
def one_shot_prompt(task, example_input, example_output, actual_input):
    """
    Create a one-shot learning prompt
    """
    return f"""Task: {task}

Example:
Input: {example_input}
Output: {example_output}

Now, please process:
Input: {actual_input}
Output:"""

# Example: Email classification
email_classifier = one_shot_prompt(
    "Classify emails as 'spam', 'work', or 'personal'",
    "Subject: URGENT! Win $1000 NOW! Click here immediately!",
    "spam",
    "Subject: Meeting agenda for tomorrow's project review"
)
```

### Few-Shot Learning

Multiple examples to establish patterns and improve accuracy.

```python
def few_shot_prompt(task, examples, actual_input, instructions=None):
    """
    Create a few-shot learning prompt with multiple examples
    """
    prompt_parts = [f"Task: {task}"]
    
    if instructions:
        prompt_parts.append(f"Instructions: {instructions}")
    
    prompt_parts.append("Examples:")
    
    for i, example in enumerate(examples, 1):
        prompt_parts.append(f"Example {i}:")
        prompt_parts.append(f"Input: {example['input']}")
        prompt_parts.append(f"Output: {example['output']}")
    
    prompt_parts.extend([
        "Now, please process:",
        f"Input: {actual_input}",
        "Output:"
    ])
    
    return "\n".join(prompt_parts)

# Example: Text classification with multiple examples
examples = [
    {"input": "The customer service was excellent!", "output": "positive"},
    {"input": "I'm disappointed with the quality.", "output": "negative"},
    {"input": "The product arrived on time.", "output": "neutral"},
    {"input": "This is the worst experience ever!", "output": "negative"},
    {"input": "Amazing quality, highly recommend!", "output": "positive"}
]

sentiment_classifier = few_shot_prompt(
    "Classify text sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral",
    examples,
    "The app works okay, nothing special.",
    "Base your classification on the overall emotional tone"
)
```

### Optimizing Shot Selection

```python
def select_optimal_examples(task_type, available_examples, target_input, num_shots=3):
    """
    Select the most relevant examples for few-shot learning
    """
    import sentence_transformers
    
    # Load embedding model for similarity
    model = sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    
    # Embed target input and available examples
    target_embedding = model.encode([target_input])
    example_embeddings = model.encode([ex['input'] for ex in available_examples])
    
    # Calculate similarities
    from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
    similarities = cosine_similarity(target_embedding, example_embeddings)[0]
    
    # Select most similar examples
    top_indices = similarities.argsort()[-num_shots:][::-1]
    selected_examples = [available_examples[i] for i in top_indices]
    
    return selected_examples

# Usage
optimal_examples = select_optimal_examples(
    "sentiment_analysis",
    examples,
    "The app works okay, nothing special.",
    num_shots=3
)
```

## üß† Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain-of-thought prompting encourages models to show their reasoning process, dramatically improving performance on complex tasks.

![Chain of Thought](../assets/chain-of-thought.png)
*How step-by-step reasoning improves AI performance*

### Basic Chain-of-Thought

```python

Example of step-by-step reasoning:
Problem: If a store has 23 apples and sells 8, then buys 15 more, how many apples does it have?

Step 1: Start with initial amount: 23 apples
Step 2: Subtract what was sold: 23 - 8 = 15 apples
Step 3: Add what was bought: 15 + 15 = 30 apples
Answer: The store has 30 apples.

Now, let's solve the actual problem:"""
        
        return f"{example}\n\n{base_prompt}"
    
    return base_prompt

# Example usage
math_problem = chain_of_thought_prompt(
    "A recipe calls for 2.5 cups of flour, but you want to make 1.5 times the recipe. If you only have a 1/3 cup measuring cup, how many times do you need to fill it?"
)
```

### Advanced Chain-of-Thought Variations

**Self-Consistency with Chain-of-Thought**
```python
def self_consistency_cot(problem, num_paths=3):
    """

    # In practice, you would generate multiple completions
    # and then analyze which answer appears most frequently

## üöÄ Advanced Prompting Techniques

Sophisticated strategies for handling complex tasks and getting optimal performance from AI models.

![Advanced Techniques](../assets/advanced-prompting.png)
*Advanced prompting strategies for complex scenarios*

### 1. Constitutional AI Prompting

Guide models to follow principles and self-correct their responses.

```python
def constitutional_prompt(task, principles, initial_response=None):
    """
    Apply constitutional AI principles to improve responses
    """
    principles_text = "\n".join([f"- {principle}" for principle in principles])
    
    if initial_response:
        return f"""Task: {task}

Initial Response: {initial_response}

Please review this response according to these principles:
{principles_text}

Questions to consider:
1. Does this response follow all the stated principles?
2. Are there any potential issues or improvements needed?
3. How can this be made more helpful, harmless, and honest?

Revised Response:"""
    else:
        return f"""Task: {task}

Please respond while carefully following these principles:
{principles_text}

Make sure your response is helpful, harmless, and honest.

Response:"""

# Example
ethical_principles = [
    "Be truthful and accurate",
    "Respect privacy and confidentiality", 
    "Avoid harmful or biased content",
    "Acknowledge limitations and uncertainty"
]

ethical_prompt = constitutional_prompt(
    "Provide advice on personal finance management",
    ethical_principles
)
```

### 2. Metacognitive Prompting

Encourage models to think about their own thinking process.

```python
def metacognitive_prompt(task, complexity_level="medium"):
    """
    Prompt that encourages metacognitive reasoning
    """
    complexity_instructions = {
        "simple": "This seems straightforward, but let me double-check my reasoning.",
        "medium": "This requires careful thinking. Let me plan my approach.",
        "complex": "This is complex and requires systematic analysis. Let me break it down carefully."
    }
    
    return f"""Task: {task}

Before I respond, let me think about this task:
- {complexity_instructions[complexity_level]}
- What knowledge do I need to apply?
- What potential mistakes should I avoid?
- How confident am I in different aspects of this task?

Let me work through this step by step, being explicit about my reasoning process and any uncertainties:

Analysis:"""

def confidence_calibration_prompt(task):
    """
    Encourage models to express uncertainty appropriately
    """
    return f"""Task: {task}

Please provide your response and then rate your confidence level for different aspects:

Response: [Your answer here]

Confidence Assessment:
- Overall confidence in this response: [High/Medium/Low]
- Most confident about: [specific aspect]
- Least confident about: [specific aspect]
- Potential sources of error: [list any concerns]
- Suggestions for verification: [how to double-check this]"""
```

### 3. Perspective-Taking Prompts

Have models consider multiple viewpoints or roles.

```python
def perspective_taking_prompt(scenario, perspectives):
    """
    Analyze a scenario from multiple perspectives
    """
    prompt_parts = [f"Scenario: {scenario}", "", "Please analyze this from multiple perspectives:"]
    
    for i, perspective in enumerate(perspectives, 1):
        prompt_parts.extend([
            f"{i}. From the perspective of {perspective}:",
            f"   - Key concerns:",
            f"   - Potential benefits:",
            f"   - Likely reactions:",
            ""
        ])
    
    prompt_parts.extend([
        "Synthesis:",
        "- Common ground between perspectives:",
        "- Key areas of disagreement:",
        "- Potential compromises or solutions:",
        "",
        "Final recommendation considering all perspectives:"
    ])
    
    return "\n".join(prompt_parts)

# Example
business_scenario = "A company is considering implementing a mandatory return-to-office policy"
stakeholders = [
    "employees who prefer remote work",
    "managers concerned about productivity", 
    "company executives focused on culture",
    "HR department managing policies"
]

multi_perspective = perspective_taking_prompt(business_scenario, stakeholders)
```

### 4. Iterative Refinement Prompts

Build up complex responses through multiple rounds of refinement.

```python
def iterative_refinement_prompt(task, iteration=1, previous_attempt=None):
    """
    Create prompts for iterative improvement
    """
    if iteration == 1:
        return f"""Task: {task}

Please provide an initial response. Focus on getting the core ideas down, and don't worry about perfection yet.

Initial response:"""
    
    else:
        return f"""Original task: {task}

Previous attempt: {previous_attempt}

Please improve this response by:
1. Adding more detail and specificity
2. Improving clarity and organization
3. Addressing any gaps or weaknesses
4. Enhancing accuracy and completeness

Iteration {iteration} (improved version):"""

def self_critique_prompt(task, response):
    """
    Have model critique its own response
    """
    return f"""Original task: {task}

My response: {response}

Now, let me critically evaluate this response:

Strengths:
- What did I do well?
- What aspects are most accurate/helpful?

Weaknesses:
- What could be improved?
- What might be missing or unclear?
- Are there any potential errors?

Suggestions for improvement:
- How would I revise this?
- What additional information would be helpful?

Revised response incorporating these insights:"""
```
